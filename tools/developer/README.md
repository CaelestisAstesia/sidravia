# Development commands

Run from the repository root with Python 3 and the pinned Go toolchain (Go 1.26.4).
`dev.py` uses the existing verifier and distribution producer/consumer. It does
not install, start the GUI/daemon, authenticate, sign, upload or publish.

```bash
python3 tools/developer/dev.py verify --scope go --go-checks native
python3 tools/developer/dev.py verify --scope go --go-checks cross
python3 tools/developer/dev.py verify --scope all
python3 tools/developer/dev.py benchmark --scope go --go-checks full --runs 3 --cache cold-warm
```

Use `--go /absolute/path/to/go` when the pinned Go is not on PATH. Normal runs
preserve Go's configured/default compile cache; do not allocate a new cache per
task. Tests still use `-count=1`, which reruns tests without discarding compiled
objects. `--jobs 2` bounds independent cross-compilation commands (1–4 supported);
Go retains its own compiler scheduling. All existing cross targets are checked.
Native tests and vet retain their order. For a small code change, use ordinary
`go test -count=1 ./affected/package/...` rather than requiring a full matrix.

Each invocation writes a unique report and complete logs under
`.project/evidence/build-efficiency/` by default (`--reports` overrides it).
Reports contain source commit, dirty status, byte fingerprint, tool/cache/host
metadata, command exits and timings. Failed checks return nonzero; source changes
during measurement invalidate the result. `cold-warm` uses one temporary empty
Go compile cache for the first run and reuses it for subsequent runs, then removes
it. Module/download and OS caches are not cleared. Compare repeated runs with the
same flags and uncontended host; the first existing-cache run has unknown warmth.

## Incremental Windows GUI and distribution

Run from Windows or WSL with Windows PowerShell interop:

```bash
python3 tools/developer/dev.py windows
python3 tools/developer/dev.py windows --check-gui
python3 tools/developer/dev.py windows --package --windows-python 'C:\Python314\python.exe' --iscc 'C:\Tools\Inno Setup\ISCC.exe'
```

The last command's Python and Inno paths are examples; supply installed native
executables. Defaults are `D:\Tools\Flutter\3.47.0\flutter\bin\flutter.bat`,
`C:\Program Files\Go\bin\go.exe`, and workspace
`D:\Tools\Sidravia\build-workspace`. Override with `--flutter`, `--windows-go`,
`--workspace`, and `--version`. No tool is downloaded or installed automatically.

The helper accepts only a new empty directory or its own marked workspace and
holds an exclusive lock. It synchronizes tracked source by SHA256, retains
unchanged file timestamps, removes only previously owned stale source files, and
keeps Flutter/CMake and Go caches on the native Windows filesystem. Interrupted
syncs retain ownership of partly copied files for the next run. Source must have
no untracked, nonignored files; build-only runs may be dirty and say so.

Every GUI request executes locked dependency resolution and incremental Release
compilation; there is no routine `flutter clean`, fresh source copy, or skip based
on EXE existence. `--check-gui` additionally runs analyze and GUI tests, stopping
on failure. Plain build-only success is not test acceptance. The package path
requires a clean commit, rechecks staged source bytes after compilation, invokes
`tools/build`, then `verify_distribution.py --smoke`. It also produces and verifies
a separate Windows core portable archive without GUI or an installer. The
report records `distribution` (GUI portable + setup) and `core_distribution`. Smoke invokes only allowed
help commands, never the installer or GUI. Reports/logs/artifacts are in the
workspace's unique `runs/` directory. Each stage streams stdout and stderr to
separate files. The helper bounds stage execution to 900 seconds and output
drain to 5 seconds; direct PowerShell callers can override `-StageTimeoutSeconds`.
On failure it saves the report, then exits. A Windows job contains this dedicated
PowerShell process and its descendants, so exit also terminates its owned tools.
Invoke the helper as a separate process (`-File`), never dot-source it.

Successful native compilation does not prove
GUI interaction, installation, notification delivery or campus behavior.

## Core distributions

From a clean Linux amd64 checkout, choose an absent output directory whose parent
exists (the repository's ignored `dist/` path is suitable):

```bash
python3 tools/developer/dev.py package --version 0.3.0-alpha.1 --output dist/linux-amd64
python3 tools/developer/dev.py package --target linux-arm64 --version 0.3.0-alpha.1 --output dist/linux-arm64
python3 tools/developer/dev.py package --target windows-arm64 --version 0.3.0-alpha.1 --output dist/windows-arm64
```

ARM64 packages contain core tools only (Windows includes the manager). They are
cross-compiled with CGO disabled and ARMv8.0 baseline. The consumer inspects
archive content, checksums and Go OS/architecture metadata without executing
foreign binaries; help smoke is recorded as `not_run`. Cross-compilation does
not establish ARM hardware compatibility. GUI and installers remain Windows
AMD64 only. The default Linux AMD64 package also runs native help smoke.

The full commit is passed as build-id; producer and consumer remain the existing
implementations. Windows AMD64 distribution must use `windows --package`, which builds
the GUI from synchronized source. A generic existing GUI directory is not accepted
as proof of current source. Go `trimpath`'s `embedded_identity=not_recorded`
limitation remains; source/build receipts and byte hashes are not independent
runtime identity proof.

Keep the latest useful build and evidence; do not automatically retain every log
or create new task caches. Remove only a helper-owned inactive run directory when
its result is no longer needed. Preserve the shared cache and active candidate.
